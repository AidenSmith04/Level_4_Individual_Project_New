| "I thought it was very cool. It was really awesome. Seeing the art up close."                                                                                                                                                                                  | Engagement and Enjoyment                              |
| "Most of the time, it was quite grandiose, especially with the 3D art. The 2D art had a more close-up and appreciative quality."                                                                                                                               | Art Preferences, Atmosphere                           |
| "The art made me appreciate most of the spaces more, although I found it quite stressful on University Avenue."                                                                                                                                                | Perception, Emotional Reactions                       |
| "The art obscured the space a bit, especially with the pillars and busy road."                                                                                                                                                                                 | Impact of Art Placement, Perception                   |
| "In the arc, the statues were very well positioned and made me appreciate the space a lot more."                                                                                                                                                               | Art Placement, Emotional Reactions                    |
| "I was quite amazed in the arc, seeing the 3D statues up close. A sense of awe."                                                                                                                                                                               | Emotional Reactions, Engagement and Enjoyment         |
| "It made me appreciate how much a space can be suited to art or not."                                                                                                                                                                                          | Perception, Impact of Art Placement                   |
| "I like how you can get up as close as you want to the art and interact with it in a way that you wouldn’t be able to if it was physically there."                                                                                                             | Interactivity, Engagement and Enjoyment               |
| "I think. It's a really good way of being able to see are without having to physically, go to where it's stored. It's simulates, a level that's probably not quite on the scale of Um, seeing the Immaculate detail up close but it does a good approximation" | Accessibility of Art, Comparison with Traditional Art |
| "In the quad and the arc, the art fit in well with the space and felt quite natural."                                                                                                                                                                          | Impact of Art Placement, Perception                   |
| "On the road, the art was positioned quite oddly, some slightly in the ground and in random places, which felt a bit unnatural."                                                                                                                               | Impact of Art Placement, Perception                   |
| "University Avenue felt too busy to look at and appreciate art. It might fit better in a different place."                                                                                                                                                     | Location Preferences, Perception                      |
| "I can’t think of any ways to make the experience more impactful because in the places where it worked, it worked really well."                                                                                                                                | Suggestions for Improvement, Emotional Reactions      |
| "I especially appreciated the 3D art. I might place statues in gardens or outdoor spaces, like in my backyard."                                                                                                                                                | Art Preferences, Location Preferences                 |
| "I would appreciate it in a sufficiently not too busy public space."                                                                                                                                                                                           | Location Preferences                                  |
| "If it were readily available, I would absolutely use it."                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Future Use, Engagement and Enjoyment                  |
