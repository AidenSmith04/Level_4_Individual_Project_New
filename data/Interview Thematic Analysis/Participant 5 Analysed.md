| "I did think it was maybe a bit concerning. When like having large art and like a public space that people could walk through. Like, um, could lead to like some collisions and even like missing wheel information, that could be important that by being like obstructed, by the AR art."                                                                                                          | Challenges and Limitations                                                |
| "Yes, definitely.

| "I think the 2D art was quite like a nice pleasurable experience. Um it kind of like added stuff to the environment like which was like normal like blank walls made kind of like more visually like enjoyable. But 3D was kind of more like intimidating kind of like a large structures and kind of like occluding which kind of like could cause stress and just in like the environment itself." | Atmosphere and Realism                                                    |

| "Probably the the problem with like, occlusion. Um, I think because I feel like a lot of, like, important, real impression can be blocked quite easily with this kind of like uh, with with either 2D or 3D art, which could be quite concerned for, for how this evolves."                                                                                                                          | Challenges and Limitations                                                |
