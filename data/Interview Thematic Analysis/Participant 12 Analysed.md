| "It was very exciting, very engaging, especially because I wanted to try the MetaQuest."                                                                                         | Initial Excitement, Novelty                        |
| "The art created by the 2D models, I enjoyed very much, but the 3D models I found very disorienting."                                                                            | Art Preferences, Disorientation                    |
| "From afar, it was okay. They were disproportionate to the world around them. Up close, the textures of the models made my brain feel uncomfortable."                            | Perception, Disorientation                         |
| "The art drew my attention away from the real world and focused on the 2D or 3D art."                                                                                            | Perception, Focus                                  |
| "It was a good thing because if the purpose was to draw attention to the art, that’s what it did."                                                                               | Purpose of Art, Art Experience                     |
| "I just liked the Banksy paintings. The red balloon made me smile because I loved that painting when I was younger."                                                             | Emotional Reactions, Art Preferences               |
| "It’s very mixed. It's cool, but the texture of the 3D models threw me off. It felt like found footage from the back rooms, which I enjoy, but the disorientation was too much." | Art Experience, Disorientation, Mixed Feelings     |
| "It’s more accessible than traditional art, but you need expensive equipment. It’s not the same as seeing it in real life, but maybe I’m just old school."                       | Accessibility, Comparison with Traditional Art     |
| "It didn’t have any particular feelings for seeing it in different locations. It made more sense in the Quad than the road, but the road didn’t feel memorable."                 | Art Placement, Perception of Space                 |
| "If the models were improved, like making sure they don’t clip through walls and fixing textures, it would be more impactful. The road setup wasn’t immersive."                  | Suggestions for Improvement, Immersion             |
| "Yes, I would use it, but I prefer VR to AR. I’m not really into virtual things in real environments."                                                                           | Preferences (VR vs. AR), Future Use                |
| "I’d like to see huge experiences, like the Sistine Chapel, in virtual space. I favor virtual over augmented reality."                                                           | Virtual Reality Preferences, Art in Virtual Spaces |
| "The AR headset shaking when moving towards my mouth made my eyes feel off, which made me feel sick."                                                                            | Discomfort, Technology Limitations                 |
