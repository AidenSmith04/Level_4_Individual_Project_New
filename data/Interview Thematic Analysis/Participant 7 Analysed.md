It made me think about art differently."                                                                                                                                                   | Engagement and Enjoyment, Impact of Art Placement                   |
| "It kind of maybe made me think about the art differently. Yo, because you used to seeing like David in Italy and, you know, the mono lisa in the Louvre in Paris. and stuff. And so um I think in some ways it makes more accessible as well."                                                            | Perception, Accessibility of Art                                    |

| " I think obviously seeing some of the more the bigger structures just made more sense outside. Yeah. And I think, Um that's quite interesting.
