| "Yeah, I think it depended a lot on the place where there was some places where it felt like the art fitted in more than others. Like, When it was like on the busy road and those people walking past, you couldn't really like it just felt really out of place, so it didn't really be able to, we didn't really create an atmosphere because it was quite disjointed, but then when it was like in the Quadrangle, for example, it was a lot more like, But you be home so they said yeah so that made it better." | Atmosphere and Realism                                                    |
