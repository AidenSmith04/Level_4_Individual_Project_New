| "I thought it was a very interesting way to experience art, different from anything I’ve done before."                                                   | 1               |

| "I enjoyed it a lot, especially seeing the art up close in a way that wouldn’t be possible in a gallery."                                                | 3               |
| "It was a cool experience, and I’d definitely do it again."                                                                                              | 4               |

| "It was a unique and enjoyable way to see art."                                                                                                          | 6               |
| "Overall, I thought it was quite fun to try, having an AR headset on and seeing public art in different spaces. It made me think about art differently." | 7               |
| "I really enjoyed it."                                                                                                                                   | 8               |

| "I was quite amazed in the arc, seeing the 3D statues up close. A sense of awe."                                                                         | 10              |

| **Interview Excerpt**                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Participant** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| "Some spaces felt enhanced by the art, while others felt cluttered."                                                                                                                                              | 1               |
| "The placement really mattered—some places felt perfect, while others were awkward."                                                                                                                              | 2               |
| "It fit best in open spaces where you could walk around the sculptures."                                                                                                                                          | 3               |
| "In the quad, the sculptures felt like they belonged there."                                                                                                                                                      | 4               |
| "The best one for me was outside the arc. I felt the placement there, with regards to the Eh where they were in the windows and actually the lighting and the style of building were far more conducive to that." | 7               |
| "It, livened up one of the spaces which there was nothing much there."                                                                                                                                            | 8               |
| "The art made me appreciate most of the spaces more, although I found it quite stressful on University Avenue."                                                                                                   | 10              |
| "On the road, the art was positioned quite oddly, some slightly in the ground and in random places, which felt a bit unnatural."                                                                                  | 10              |
| "In the cloister, it immediately transformed the space into a quiet museum."                                                                                                                                      | 9               |
| "In some environments, it definitely added to the space. The art worked best in the ARC and the Quad, as they matched the environments well."                                                                     | 11              |
| "In the Quad, with the 3D models, it made the space feel less open and more closed in, but in the road, it felt out of place."                                                                                    | 11              |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| "It made me think about art differently, especially how it interacts with space."                                                           | 1               |
| "It was a new way to see things that I might not have noticed otherwise."                                                                   | 2               |
| "The scale of the sculptures really stood out to me in a way that doesn’t happen in galleries."                                             | 3               |
| "It made me appreciate how the environment shapes the way we see art."                                                                      | 4               |
| "It changes what you see when you stop looking at the art."                                                                                 | 8               |
| "It made it more interesting and made it look bigger, feel bigger."                                                                         | 9               |
| "Most of the time, it was quite grandiose, especially with the 3D art. The 2D art had a more close-up and appreciative quality."            | 10              |
| "It made me appreciate how much a space can be suited to art or not."                                                                       | 10              |
| "Seeing the art in a different place was definitely interesting, but it also took away from the experience because it didn't feel as real." | 11              |

## **Comparison with Traditional Art**

| **Interview Excerpt**                                                                                                                     | **Participant** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| "I liked being able to move around the art freely, unlike in a gallery."                                                                  | 1               |
| "It was more interactive than a museum, but less tangible."                                                                               | 2               |
| "This was better because I could stay there as long as I wanted."                                                                         | 8               |

| "It does not replace the art, it's not the same experience. But it allows me to prod and poke and see it from angles, I couldn't expect." | 9               |
| "It’s not the same as seeing it in real life, but maybe I’m just old school."                                                             | 12              |

| "It’s nice to experience famous works without needing to go abroad."           | 2               |

| **Interview Excerpt**                                                                                                                                   | **Participant** |

| "I was excited by being able to walk around statues and see them from different angles."                                                                | 8               |
| "I like how you can get up as close as you want to the art and interact with it in a way that you wouldn’t be able to if it was physically there."      | 10              |
| "Just the end with the big metal statue outside the ARC, getting to walk under it and interact with it, even though I couldn’t touch it, it felt real." | 11              |

## **Suggestions for Improvement**

|**Interview Excerpt**|**Participant**|
|---|---|
|"Better guidance on how to use the headset would be helpful."|1|
|"Textures could be improved to make the sculptures feel more lifelike."|2|
|"Maybe the texture quality could be improved. I'm not sure if it’s a quality issue, or just how AR looks right now. I think it will get better with time."|11|
|"If the models were improved, like making sure they don’t clip through walls and fixing textures, it would be more impactful."|12|

## **Safety Concerns**

| **Interview Excerpt**                                                   | **Participant** |

| "It was hard to be aware of my surroundings while focusing on the art." | 1               |

| "Kept feeling David (the statue) would be run over by a taxi."          | 8               |

## **Future Use & Technology Preferences**

|**Interview Excerpt**|**Participant**|
|---|---|
|"I’d love to try this again with more art pieces."|1|
|"I think AR is a great way to showcase public art."|2|
|"Oh yeah, I would use it."|8|
|"If it were readily available, I would use it."|9|
|"If it were readily available, I would absolutely use it."|10|
|"I would definitely give it another shot. It would be interesting to see the same art with better quality as the technology improves."|11|
|"Yes, I would use it, but I prefer VR to AR. I’m not really into virtual things in real environments."|12|
