Thank you for participating. Yeah. In this interview, we're interested in understanding your overall experience with the AR public art. This conversation is about your thoughts and feelings. There are no right or wrong answers. Uh firstly what was your overall impression of the experience? Um, fun and colourful. Cool. How would you describe the overall atmosphere created by the art?

Um, Like a modern. Sort of, Like, I guess type of experience like Don't have any sense, obviously, since it's an experience but it's something that's actually happening to you if that makes sense. Realistic. More like an individualised thing. Okay, yes. Um how did the art change your perception of the space? Um, it made it more colourful and it made that a bit a bit nicer to look at Um, How did the art make you feel emotionally, any specific moments of emotion that you can recall?

Um really happy especially when for most of the 3D art. I feel like it was really cool to see it in space. Uh you say most of it was there one in particular that you didn't enjoy so much and university Avenue. I feel like it was a bit too busy.

Maybe most of them are too big for a street that was quite narrow, but the other ones were cool. Uh, following on from that. What kind of 3D art, would you put on a road like University Avenue? Or would you just omit it entirely? I was debating answering omiting it entirely but I actually really liked the fireman statue.

Um, because I feel like when it's When it's like, a more narrow space. I feel like maybe Realistic looks better like the statue look quite realistic whereas the other spaces were more. Open, and had more of a modern but.

Spacious Open View. So when you put the 3D art in it and You could kind of, you know, it felt more and contrast but not out of place. So would you say that the main issue was the types of art or like the size position of the art the size and type I would say for that space.

I feel like for that one. It should be more realistic. Statue blend in, especially because there's a lot of people walking about. So you kind of want it to like Not, there was not to get rid of you. Thank you. Uh what's stood out to you most about this experience as a piece of art?

I thought it was quite interesting, Especially because, as well. Like, you know, other people aren't seeing what you're seeing. So first, by individualised to you, and I feel like he's a piece of art. It was quite interesting because its a new way of doing public art. That's never been done before.

the only thing ill say though Is that people's staring can kinda take away from it, hear me from an art experience who's our Kenneth not as focused on the art um in following on from that. How do you think this AR art installation compares to other different ways of experiencing arts such as galleries or traditional public art? Um, I think it's more Fun, Feel like I think ive been to galleries before and I feel it when the niceness you can talk to other people about it, whereas it can be kind of awkward to talk to someone about this if you have to take off the headset and give them it but I think it's really cool that

if you wanted to you could like move the art or like you can like test it and see and put it in places that maybe.

are hard to build an, or you could. Like art that you never actually see in real life. That brings me on to uh my next question quite well. In fact, how did you feel about seeing these art pieces in a place different from their original or intended location? Most most things are actually enjoyed it and particularly statue, David and The banksy photo I feel like it was quite nice to see you and they work quite well with a lot of the places.

Okay, thank you. Is there anything you think could make this experience more impactful or memorable? And maybe more customised art for the spaces. But I think for the 3D art of worked well for most places so It's not necessity, but maybe a first pitch. Uh, would you, uh, would, if this was our available, uh, freely available?

Would you use this? What kind of Arts would you like to see in which locations? Yeah, i would definitely use it. It's been fun. I'd probably use it. Maybe in like a park maybe somewhere. It's Quite open. Maybe even like my house or front garden or something for fun, but Um yeah I think I would definitely use it.

Like, the type of art we probably be like Classic art or even just like stuff that I thinks quite colourful. Uh, thank you for, for sharing your thoughts. Is there anything else you'd like to add about your experience with the AR art installation? Um, That was really fun, and And I think it's quite be able to sing.

Uh, thank you before we go. Are there any questions you have about this? Um, no cool. Uh thank you very much for your participation.
