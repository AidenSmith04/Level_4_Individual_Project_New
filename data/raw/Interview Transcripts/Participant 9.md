Do you consent to me regarding you? Cool, thank you. Thank you for participating in this interview, we are interested in understanding your overall experience with the AR public art. This conversation is about your thoughts and feelings. There are no right or wrong answers. Firstly, what was your overall impression of the experience?

It was quite fun. It was fun to have art at The fridge. Um, how would you describe the overall atmosphere created by the art? Well, I told him that depends, it's on the space. So in in, on the street, Didn't feel like there's an atmosphere. Uh, and a cloister it was very Pleasant and sort of.

Somber. And it felt like Museum. But it was very nice. Uh, it was very entertaining on the on Our next to Arc, right? It was more fun than museum. It was like street art. Um, Speaking of the art, did it change your perception of the space and if so in what ways?

Of the space. Yes. Yes, it did with the arc. It made it more interesting and made it look bigger, feel bigger. Because they were doing a lot. Of job took sir. With 2D art. Not so much. In Ark. With the art, not so much at. Um, with 3D art the the my perception of a space on the street was that it was very cramped.

Um, Speaking of, Feelings. How did they are make you feel emotionally? Are there any specific moments of emotion that you can recall? Yeah, it felt. Quite somewhere, like a war memorial Holocaust Memorial to the big black sculpture. They've been memory of like that that I've seen Berlin. There's a large cubicle and it's just an open space.

So that was quite an emotional and in a cloister it's just immediately transformed space into like A quiet Museum. Um, Next. Once stood out to you most about this experience, An understand this and there is how realistic things up close can get. And with VR sets. I don't think the real world is not very realistic.

It's very, for me. I don't see it very well. It has lots of black crosses on it and things and dots, right and gives me double vision but those were much more realistic than the things that I've seen and how It was very pleasant to see things in the large scale.

From angles that you may not be able even if you go to the museums where they are. So, that was very Quite nicely to my next question. Um, how do you think this AR our installation compares to other more, maybe more traditional ways of experiencing art such as galleries or other forms of public art?

I think it's a very good. Extension. And How do I put it? What's a good phone? Filled the gaps of accessor to speak. It does not replace the art, it's not the same experience. But it allows me to prod and poke and seed from angles, I couldn't expect. Uh, and look at the details and maybe Just, You're still more in control of experience, of the art, there's plenty of pieces, like Mona lisa that Seeing the big rooms with lots of people and you can't get close enough in the flashes everywhere and stuff like that.

So being able to get close to that paint. If it's good, resolution will be very, very pleasant. All the sculptures were very nice with immersive and you may not always be able to Walk through immersive sculptures like the like the black sculpture. There are some like the Holocaust Memorial Berlin but this one isn't, but some of them are not accessible.

You can't feel like walk through and I walked through the black one every time. Um, related to that. How did you feel about seeing this art pieces in a place different from their original or intended locations? I felt an arc, not to argules, very appropriate. It just felt, right?

It's like, it could have been there every day. As an addition, sculptures and anxiety public spaces that felt good in, in a role. It it felt slightly dangerous. Uh, the the 2D art felt very good in the road. It felt like it would be entertaining to happen. Something to look on away.

What the structure from? A misery of climbing up the hill or something like that. But the sculpture is not so much. Okay. Um, is there anything you think could make this experience more impactful or memorable?

This particular testing or general having access to our yeah, this kind of experience in general. Not having to to operate up and down and having a skill to do it, have them layered and having and having to be able to choose the layer as well. Because the large sculptures, sometimes, it's fun to be on top of them.

And look at them on top. Yeah. The paintings I would very much like them to be much closer or much bigger if they are supposed to be behind, it's that because I didn't really much enjoy the painting, except the two that I could approach closely, right? Uh, that I set up to be close and outside the wall.

So that was very fun. Getting to put your face next to the painting with good resolution. That was really different. Yeah. But the ones that I couldn't see too well, or they were Didn't know if you entertaining. Cool. Um, if you were to use this This type of experience in your everyday life, what kinds of arts would you?

You would you place in what kind of locations would you place them? Hmm.

Everyday life. If I have choice and options in space, I'll definitely. I want to put paintings in my walls. And I would definitely want to put a nice culture to cover up again. Church outside. Or. Or a building that I like to look at. Or not something time to walk through.

But but like, A David sculpture in house in the garden. You know, something like that. And I would like to have options to change that. To reflect my mood or desire. But just having that around would be fantastic, but more in a private setting, maybe you're not work because we more and more hot task and the space is so Unfriendly and a neutral and empty, right?

And just get into work and clicking button having your own art around. And nobody else can see it and nobody trips over it and I want ripped over it. Fantastic. Fantastic. Because so impersonal. Um, okay. Um, A lot of questions. Would you use this? If this was available as a as an experience you readily available.

Really available as an experience. I go and experience it in a cloister or as I buy it and have it if you, if you could use this in your everyday life. I think I would so although I wouldn't put the quality of the gear because I can't read up with them or something, right?

Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Is there anything else you'd like to add about your experience with the AR art installation? No, I think I've wrote everything into things, it's Is there an option to make unit on Google classes? Um so this is um, preliminary research Um, partially inspired by the upcoming meta, Orion, which is similar to the Google Glass.

Um, so this is, this is a proof of concept of prototype or something that might be used on. The reason why I'm asking is because the this particular headgear is just really not good for work every in everyday life. Yeah, you need to put it and have an experience like Google classes, you can walk around Uh cool before we go.

Do you have any questions from me about the study? No, cool. Thank you very much.
