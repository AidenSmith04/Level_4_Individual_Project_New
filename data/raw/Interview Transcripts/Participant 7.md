Thank you for participating in this interview. We're interested in understanding your overall experience with the AR public art. This conversation is about your thoughts and feelings. There are no right or wrong answers. Firstly, what was your overall impression of the experience? Overall, I'm I thought it was quite fun to try.

And having an AR you know headset on and seeing public art. Um in a different space. Obviously some of the art used was fairly famous. I'm fortunate, from that point of view, it was kind of interesting to see a new locations, you know, locations that I kind of know.

Um, So, Um, It kind of maybe made me think about the art differently. Yo, because you used to seeing like David in Italy and, you know, the mono lisa in the Louvre in Paris and stuff. And so um I think in some ways it makes more accessible as well. Um, you know, not everybody has the luxury to go and see it.

In person. Um, so it's kind of fun. What was I more? So there's some really good, you know, I think the last Bit when we were outside the ark, you know, particularly with the 3D sculptures was, you know, um, You know really interesting. You know that's kind of where I had more fun and particularly with the more more modern art that you could then go in and out or rather than sort just looking at something.

So, from a participatory perspective and trying to get an understand that that was better um because in a museum you get nowhere near that. You know, they would have barriers around it and so I think that was kind of The better really stood out for me is like, What could the opportunity be to get really up close even on a 2D art, you know, I obviously with the chucking paint at the Mona Lisa recently, you know I can imagine that the more and more security measures and stuff.

Uh, speaking of of that. Um, you mentioned, uh, galleries, uh, how do you think this kind of AR art installation compared to the other, maybe more traditional ways of experiencing or like a gallery or public art? I think in at intrinsically I was thinking about Doing a comparison in my head even you know subconsciously I was unconsciously doing it.

Um, I think that. I was expecting more. Connections guidance. Maybe between different bits of the art. If you look in a gallery, you know, particularly the 2D art, for example, you know if you look in the 2D art, you know you usually would be Spacing between arts at particular thing that kind of guide you and has enough you know space for people around about you know and it kind of zoned you know, it's thematic and whatever.

So Um, you know, that was a little bit that was kind of more freestyle for me. So I think obviously, I'm not saying it's good or bad. I'm just saying it was different. I think obviously seeing some of the more the bigger structures just made more sense outside. Yeah.

And I think, Um that's quite interesting. Um, seeing those things, you know, more outside, um, But some of the locations didn't work for me quite the same. You know, on different levels, you know, for some of them it was more safety, you know, when I was, you know, by beside the busy road and there are people coming around, you know, at times I couldn't see cyclists.

Uh, and so if I was, you know, or pedestrians. So if I was doing that actually, that wouldn't be, you know, so great. I could see accidents happening there. Um I think in a calmer space you know where the first one was in the courts and obviously in outside the art where it was calmer and it was fewer people.

But maybe we're lucky today wasn't so busy. Um, I just, it would be interested to see what it'd be like on a busier day. Um, If everybody was wearing AR headset, you know, is it a little bit like Cannonballs you know, bumping into each other because you don't have that, you know, peripheral vision.

So you know, might there need to be some kind of Support, you know, something that maybe guides people. And so, even if you could have a freestyle, maybe there's a kind of preferred path somehow that's, you know, in a headset you could perhaps you know, guide people couldn't you, you know, in an art gallery, they're often is that go this way or, you know, it's ties to It doesn't force you but there's some subtle cues that guide you and ask me perhaps in a particular direction or allow you to have autonomy to have for yourself.

Um, Going back to what you mentioned about, how how it changed your perception of this book. Could you speak further on that?

Well, the first place was very Traditional let say. Um, And so,

I have, you know, certain perceptions and in a normal way, you know, it would be calm, you know, being in the quads for example, but I thought it was quite interesting to have the sum of the a, you know, the The 3D art there. Um, I wasn't so sure the modern one worked to me, but then maybe that was just my initial reaction in terms of I was expecting something more in line with um the setting and therefore the the more the grey metal more modern thing was something that It just didn't seem to sit there but I could imagine that some artists you know are exhibitors might want to be provocative and maybe actually the contrast is the thing that they're trying to get people to think about in the context of the quads.

I wasn't quite sure how that particular installation. You know, uh, actually what it's supposed to be provoking, you know, in terms of was it You know, trying to revoke a particular reaction, was it trying to be adjusted position. So um, The 2d one, that's the one that you know, From that kind of art installation.

That's where I struggled a little bit more. The best one for me was outside the arc. I felt the placement there, with regards to the Eh where they were in the windows and actually the lighting and the style of building were far more conducive to that. It just didn't seem you know.

Um, Too weird. You know, you could actually imagine that was behind something to protective glass type thing and so, um, The bit that I think I struggled about with the 2D art was um depth of field. You know, um, you had to get quite close to the art in order for it to come into focus.

And I suppose, If you were an art lover, that might Be something you might not find something so aesthetically or so enjoyable. Because some people, you might, you know, I've seen people in art, um, in art galleries, that sit on the benches that are like six feet away. Yeah. And they look at them, they get an overall picture and then you might look at them for particular angles, so, From that point of view, if you can't have things in focus over a range of distances that might be something that could be frustrating because you only really get the

The full visual impact when you're about two feet away or that's my perception, you know?

Um, So we we've talked quite a lot about the more, um, Cognitive side of what you're seeing and how you processed it. But speaking emotionally. Uh, how did it make you feel? Are there any particular moments of like emotion that you can recall? Yeah, I'm in the ark. Let me go to 3D in the modern art, the great black thing.

Um, I actually have fun. Um it it felt like something that you could go, you know, walk through and explore. And you know, even when I was looking back the placement of the discus and statue. You know, I could look through one of the square windows, if you want in that installation and see another one.

And so that ability to reframe art, you know, in a public space was, was quite fun. It was, you know, it's kind of fun to play with that. Um, and imagine that, you know, if you consciously were thinking, you know, an artist was consciously thinking of that, there's actually some really clever things that you can do.

Um, yeah, I think, as I said to you when you were, you making sure you're out safe. Was. I could see people playing, you know, if you had, you know, a shared experience. Um, I suppose that, you know, one thing that I kind of I know it's maybe Too much of the zeitgeist in terms of, we take photographs of everything, but it would be nice.

Just Because I was the only one, you know, to kind of have taken having ability to take, you know, a shot of that right. You know, if somebody you know screenshot or whatever the word is um of that just to kind of have a kind of image to then, reflect on to share with somebody else to share that fun.

Yeah, I'd have with that because And I suppose, Doing alone was one of the things that I don't often do I don't go to the art gallery of my own, you know, unless it was, you know, when I was very, very young, um, you know, when I was travelling around Europe and stuff but usually there was somebody from the, um, Youth host or somebody that I was going with, you know, so I think art, in some way, you know, come unless you're an artist is something you want to talk about, right?

Um, so from that point of view, I I been treated, you know, how it could become a shared experience, you know, but no, I loved it. That it was fun, um, walking around, you know, in terms of emotion I the dissonance for me was really on the University Avenue.

You know, I'm with too many people and even though the spacing placements already of The statues across the road seemed logical. I wouldn't cross the roads, you know, to go. Look at it. It just seemed like what that's a nice place, but it's kind of out touch. Yeah, and so it felt a bit frustrating.

In that sense. Where when we were in the safer spaces, Like the quad, but I think really in the ark, there was far more freedom because obviously, in the quad, we couldn't go in the grass. So there wasn't the ability to get closer to the Arts. Yeah, I think that ability to To move about.

I, you know, I'm and that was a bit frustrating in the quads the 2D. On the the old windows. Just didn't resonate. It just seemed weird. I kind of looked at it was like I just didn't seem, you know, right like the right thing. Um, And it might be.

That I just got more used to what I could do with the technology. Um by the time I got to the last one because as I evolved and I could, you know, I thought right? Can I get closer? Yeah, and things. So maybe there's a learning curve for people or I think we're going to do this, you know that um, You know, how do they experiment, how do they learn to use this, you know, in a way that's going to really help them.

Yeah. Um, that brings me nicely on to my last question. Uh, if this were, um, Publicly available to use in everyday life. Would you use it? And if so, what kind of art, what kind of art would you like to see? And where would you like to see it?

Intriguing question. What went through my head is, am I creating the art? Or I'm able to watch somebody else our installation. And so, you know, Let me answer, both of those. If I, you know, I could see this being really Great for young artists in a sense that if they're trying to do big art, it's obviously costly from a point of view of placing something and get informations or being waterproofing.

All these other things. So, Um, it could be that From that point of view, um, That it gives them a canvas, it gives them, you know, a story to tell by actually putting them in a particular journey and they could be, you know, a kind of navigation. And you could see it being used in terms of guided storytelling in some ways.

And I, I could see that could be really, really powerful, you know. Um, I could open up other things because, you know, how that could open you neighbourhoods. To your these type of art installations. Yeah, you know, not necessarily in the city centre or in a famous building location, you know it could be more fluid and so I am, I could see that being really, you know, for me personally, You have to do the other version of it.

Um,

Would I use it? My initial reaction is. No that's probably not because I can't say could be useful as I just talked about. I think it's largely that I'm not somebody that looks at art. Yeah. So, maybe that's just my reflection. Maybe the provocative thing to me is like, could Encourage me to be a bit more aware of my surroundings, you know, in a way because Often when we're going in familiar paths, we get very kind of in the group and we just do it on automatic pilot.

Yeah. You know, is there an option, you know, could that be an option to Open things up me or make things look, you know more interesting. Uh, thank you very much for sharing. Your thoughts. Is there anything else you'd like to add about your experience with the AR our installation?

I don't think so, you know, I think it was, it was fun to, to be able to see this, you know, I there were contrasting locations, you know, different pieces of art. I think the banksy are in a 2d was the one that kind of felt that most seemed in context, you know, the the more historic ones, you know, just didn't necessarily seem to sit as well, right, you know, um, So from that point of view, you know, and I think also because of the depth of field I should, you know, the 3D art was the one that kind of just was a bit more realistic, you know?

Whereas obviously, as I've talked about previously, you know, trying to get the focus of the TDR to actually say it was. You obviously a thing that I I think was the biggest barrier. Okay to to me, um, These other little thing just to mention is that the navigation, you know, when I saw the 2D art, you know, far away, It just felt weird because of the size of it, you know.

Um I think a commented that maybe one of the things to be doing is like don't show The details. If it was far away. You could have some kind of like number or some kind of, you know, right. You know, icon that basically says that is something over here.

I'm with some details but you know, trying to kind of look Up of the image was I think, was just a bit too much, obviously, that, that might complicate things, but that's just my my phone. Uh, before we wrap up, are there any questions you have for me about the study?

No, thank you so much. Thank you, thank you very much.
