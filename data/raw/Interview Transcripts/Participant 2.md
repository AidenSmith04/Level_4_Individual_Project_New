Hello, thank you for participating in this interview. Uh, we're interested in understanding your overall experience with the AR Public art. This conversation is about your thoughts, and and feelings. There is no right or wrong answers. All right. Firstly, what was your overall impression of the experience? Um I had a good impression of it.

It was it was like a good way to consume the media especially for folk like can't get to if like art that's held in other venues across the world. Be a nice way to actually. Visually explore. Like artworks exists without needing to Like, you know, pay for a flight over to a particular gallery or whatever.

Um, it's and it was It was an interesting way to To like to display onto the real world as well because it's like you still have that awareness of reality. So, like a closed box room and you can put it anywhere rather than putting and dedicated. Office or warehouse spaces or whatever.

So, it makes it makes a lot of sense. How would you describe the overall atmosphere created by the art? Um, I'd say that it like, with the art being there, like, I feel like adds like something but like, it doesn't detract too much from the atmosphere of, just like being there itself but like it adds that Um, like sense of there being Like, I don't know, the the art is there so you can go and look at it and it adds the sort of I'm going for aspect of like, Like you ask the aspect of like culture to Spaces.

But it like doesn't detract too much from the spaces that are there, which is good. Like it's not. I I know it's not like Obstructive of being in the space that you've choosed to display the item. So that's that's good. How would you how did the art change your perception of the space?

Um, it Helped. Actually, it was like The scene where art Like is and how it was displayed. Let's see like It gives you like more aspect of. Objects in. In this space. So it's like, The things you like. Things. I'm not sure I'm going for here. What's the question just the expression? Um, How did the art change your perception of the space?

It definitely, it made it brought a bigger focus to where the art was. So whether that be in the street or in the wall or whatever, it's it adds the sort of like Because like otherwise it's like your focus is like the middle of the quad for instance, but then with the art being there, you can focus on other.

Places around the space. Uh, yeah, it's some extra Dimensions to Okay. Uh, how did the AR make you feel emotionally any specific moments of emotion? You can recall? Um, it's just is very interesting seeing the the models themselves and like being able to walk around the statues and like, i remember being like, Um, particularly like Fascinated with the Been able to see thank all around it and been out to like properly view the details.

And also when the artworks were closer up as well like the paintings and the 2D one, Um, it was very cool. I've been able to see the specific details of the paintings that were displayed. Cool. Um, Related to that. What stood out to you most about this experience as a piece of art, Um,

The experience, it's that it can be placed anywhere and that It's It is quite it was quite cool seeing it around spaces that I'm familiar with. Um, so like the standout would just sort of be I don't know, it's like you could, it could be, I could see that being intricate like, integrated into like Like a standard like daily routine even like in a commute or something and it not being too obtrusive and it was like I was intrigued about how it could be used in the future for for, the display of art and just public places.

Um, Uh, how do you think this AR art installation compares to the other ways of experiencing are like galleries or traditional? Public art? Um, I mentioned briefly in that already. I think the the classical displays. Um, Obviously you actually have something like physical, you can see but a lot of the time you can't get that close.

Anyway, these ones, you can actually get up close and see around the models. Um, and Which we're fitting well enough in with the surroundings to make the appear as like, as if they were there themselves, and it was, you could probably get up close and see detail on them.

Um, so I think it's like, Like if you could afford, if you can make it out to the galleries, I'd possibly like I would go I would go with that. But the having the option to To view the art anywhere and do any piece of art anywhere as well.

It's definitely the one I can see being like used in the future. You touch us a little in in your last answer. But how did you feel about seeing these art pieces in the place different from their original or intended locations? Um, it's it was is quite fascinating quite interesting actually because then you get to see them for scale with things you're familiar with rather than In galleries and like you see them and then close space.

So you have kind of a sense of scale relative to you but like when they're actually in the space, where, you're familiar with it. It was more impactful and gives a better, like, impression of how it fits into the space and it's again livens up the spaces as well.

It's it's quite nice seeing the artwork around the places you're familiar with. Uh, is there anything you think could make this experience more impactful or memorable? Um, Possibly, just some, maybe, maybe some sort of, like, guided, like tour, like, like having like, The equivalent of, like, Like an art person working at the art gallery to then directly around the artworks to give some form of like Yeah, like tour between like This is this painting, this is this Wing or whatever so you could add in definitely some interactive elements for that.

But Um, it's a, it's a very good. I like the concept and I like the basis far of the The the art being in AI, I think it's a very good starting point. Sure. If this. Became available to use in the real world. Would you use it? And if so, what kind of Arts and which locations would you typically use it?

Um, I probably would be interested in using it for sure, because it, as I said before, it's be nice to be able to just sort of go through a menu and select a piece of art, you want to look at and just have it there. Um, I would probably I I don't know if I would use it too much on busy areas, like, roads or things like that.

I'd probably reserve using it to more like secluded areas and or maybe even indoor areas if that were an option as well. Um, Um, but uh, especially with the risk of other people being in. Just like in public and streets, like, people the intrusion to other people in the public space.

I'd be once avoid, but definitely indoor spaces and around like enclosed spaces in Um, parks are in the quad for instance. Um, thank you for showing your thoughts. Is there anything else you'd like to add about your experience? With the AR int art installation. Um, No, it just it was it was a very interesting concept and I'd like I would be interested to see how it could be played around with and expanded upon but no other question.

Uh before we go, are there any questions you have for me? No, no questions for you. Okay. Thank you very much. Yeah.
