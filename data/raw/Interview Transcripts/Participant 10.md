Thank you for participating in this interview. We're interested in understanding your overall experience with the AR Public Art. This conversation is about your thoughts and feelings. There are no right or wrong answers. Firstly, what was your overall impression of the experience? I thought it was very cool. It was really awesome.

Seeing the art up close. In the spaces. How would you describe the overall atmosphere created by the art?

Um, It was sort of. Most of the time, it was sort of quite grandiose, especially with the 3D art. And then there was a sort of more Um, close up and Sort of. Um, Appreciative quality to the 2D art. Okay. Um did your did the art change your perception of the space and if it did how how did do so The yeah, the art made me appreciate Most of the spaces more, although I found it was quite stressful in University Avenue.

Why what any particular reasons? Why you found it? Particularly stressful there? The are sort of obscured the space a bit, especially with the pillars and it was some sort of busy road. Um, which was challenging. But on the other hand, I think, especially in the ark. Uh, the statues were very well positioned and maybe appreciate the space a lot more.

Cool. Uh how did the AR art make you feel emotionally? Are there any specific moments of emotions you can recall? Um, I was quite amazed in the ark, seeing the 3D statues up close. Um, sort of sense of awe there. Um, what stood out to you most about this experience, as a piece of art, I, I think it's sort of.

Made me appreciate how, um, how much a space, you know, can be suited to our or not? And Uh, what was the question again? Uh, what stood out to you mashed about the experience as a piece of art. Oh, I think it was really interesting way to view it.

I like how you can get up as close as you want to the art and sort of Kind of interact with it in a way that you wouldn't be able to. Um, if it was physically there, Speaking of physical art, how do you think this ARR installation compares to other, maybe more traditional ways of experiencing arts such as galleries or or traditional public art?

I think. It's a really good way of being able to see are without having to physically, go to where it's stored. It's simulates, a level that's probably not quite on the scale of Um, seeing the Immaculate detail up close but it does a good approximation Okay. Um, On on that topic.

How did you feel about seeing these art pieces in a place different from their original or intended locations? I feel like, In the quad and the arc, they very much fit in the space. They um, Felt like quite natural to be there for the most part. Um, I'm I noticed that you didn't think there weren't natural additions to the road.

Are there any particular reasons why? They sort of were positioned. Quite oddly some slightly in the ground and um in sort of more random places that Um, a bit unnatural. Do you think it would be? It would be possible or you would, would you would like to find a way to have this art, displayed on some other place.

I wrote like University Avenue. I personally think, um, For me, that that space felt too busy to look at and appreciate art from I feel like there might be ways to make the art fit better into the space but overall it wouldn't be my preferred place to view it from.

Okay. Um, Is there anything you think could make this experience more impactful or memorable? Um, I think in the places where I found the installations to really work, They did really work for me and I can't think of any ways to Um, Make that better because it was already really good.

Cool. Um, If you were to use this in your everyday life, what kind of art would you place? And where would you place it? It's a good question. Thank you. Um,

I, I did, especially appreciate the 3D art. I think I might try to look at a bunch of statues. Try place them in Gardens, or Um, Outdoor spaces and see how they looked. You know, in my backyard or something. Okay. Um, yeah, would you would you use it in any public spaces as opposed to more private spaces?

I, I think in a sufficiently, um, Not too busy public space. The. I would appreciate that. Yeah, go Um, Last question. If this were readily available to to use in your everyday life, would you use it? Yeah, if it was accessible to me, then. I would absolutely use it.

Cool. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us. Uh, is there anything else you'd like to add about your experience with the AR or installation? Not particularly I think he covered most of it. Um are there before we go are there any questions you have for me about the study?

How about the study? No particularly okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.
