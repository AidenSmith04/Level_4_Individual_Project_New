Do you consent to being recorded for this interview? Uh, yes. Cool. Uh, thank you for participating in this interview. We're interested in understanding your overall experience with the AR public art. This conversation is about your thoughts and feelings. There are no right or wrong answers. At firstly what was your overall impression of the experience?

Yeah. It was it was uh, definitely good. I've never used any AR headset like that before, so I didn't really have any pre. Um, expectations. So I don't know where it takes back but, uh, Yeah, it was definitely. An interesting. Experience. But how would you describe the overall ex atmosphere created by the art?

I think in some of the

Environments that we walked around. It definitely added. I think. I, I They work best. Here, the at the, an arc. Um, They also did work very well in the Quad. I think they just matched. Are there. So it wasn't should vast. Different. Okay. How did the art change your perception of the space?

And we, uh, well like I was saying the like, so, and the quad I do think in the quad. With the 3D models. Um, Definitely filled up that space. Um it made it a lot. Not claustrophobic, that's not the right word but it was a lot more. Yeah, closed in. It didn't feel as open.

And then, With this, what's that with like where the road? Um, It just felt. Kind of out of place, right? I didn't fat in that environment. To me. Yeah.

Um how did the AR art make you feel emotionally? Are there any specific moments of emotion you can recall? Um, Uh yeah, just the end. With. The big metal stature. Um, Outside the ARC. Getting to actually walk under it. And interacting with it. Uh, even though I, Touch it and feel that it's still.

As if it was real. Yeah. Cool. Um what stood out to you most about this experience as a piece of art

Um, I think.

Let's send all arty. Um, I think well yeah, that's what art is. Is to make people feel feel a certain way. Feel feel. Something. Um, and I think this definitely got that across. Whether it was just going up to like a wall, like a flat wall and looking at Uh, like a like a real painting.

Um, Or yeah, getting to interact with. That this massive tall statues. Um, Yeah, I mean It gives you the opportunity to Almost. See, yeah, almost see these real things. Um, But obviously, in augmented reality. Yeah, I haven't seen you mentioned. How art is about making people? Feel certain things.

Do you think, um, the AR experience changed how how you would have felt seeing this art compared to More traditional ways of experiencing art like a gallery or more traditional public are I am.

I think.

I think yes in some ways. Um, Like, Texture wise. There were some textures were a bet off. Um and I think that is a big part of especially paintings and stuff. Obviously. Um, So yeah, I think there was I think it's not as good as real life. Because you're still messing those Little details that.

Are so important and in art. Um, On on that topic. Um, how did you feel seeing these art pieces in the in? In the place that's different from their original or maybe even their intended location.

Yeah, I it was It was definitely interesting with obviously. Just having some some of the world's most famous paintings, just on a wall on a window. Yeah, I was. Yeah, I feel like I guess that's kind of going back to the last question as well about Yeah, seeing them.

A place. And, you know, They aren't, um, I think does also take away a bit. Because you're looking around to surrendering that you are familiar with. And there's something new here. Um, Yeah, I don't know if that makes sense and some and so, in some ways, It's not as.

Real, it's not as real feeling because you're looking at a space that, you know, And you know that that's not actually there. Yeah, is there anything? About the. You think could make this experience more impactful or memorable? Um, I think. Maybe this is just I don't, I'm not, I'm not familiar with the the AR.

Um, Stuff. So I'm not sure. Like, Texture wise is what I'm trying to get into is I don't know if that's a quality thing in it, in the sense of I, That is just how. Things. Look. Right now. And the and the Time that we are living in right now.

Um, and well yeah, they will probably get better as time goes on. And, Uh, yeah. But Yeah, yeah. Um If this were publicly available, is this something that you might use? Would you be interested in using? Um, Yeah, I would definitely give another shot. Uh, I definitely I definitely like to see maybe even the same things that I saw today.

Like later done line. Fd. Like, get better quality or Uh, whatever. Um, I think it would be interesting to see that kind of progression is Time goes and the the equipment evolves. Okay. Um, Cool. Thank you for showing your thoughts. Is there anything else you'd like to add about your experience with the AR art installation?

I don't, I don't think so. I mean yeah, it was overall a good experience. Um, and I enjoyed myself cool, uh, before we rack up, um, are there any questions you have for me about this study?

Don't think so. Thank you. So, let us know everything in advance. Thank you very much.
