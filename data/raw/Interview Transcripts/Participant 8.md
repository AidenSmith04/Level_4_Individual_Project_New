There are no right or wrong answers. Firstly. What was your overall impression of the experience? I really enjoyed it. Good. Um, How would you describe the overall atmosphere created by the Art?

Atmosphere. I, I felt excited so I suppose it. The atmosphere was exciting. Good. Yeah. Was there anything in particular? You were excited by being able to walk around statues and see them from different angles? Okay. Um, I was somewhat related to that. How did the art change your perception of the space?

It, livened up one of the spaces which there was nothing much there. Didn't like it in the middle of the road. I mean in On University Avenue but I did like it in the quadrangle. That gave me a completely different perspective of the space. Was there any particular reason you can think of about why you didn't like it on the on University Avenue?

Kept feeling David would be run over by a taxi. Uh, yes. Okay. How did the AR art make you feel emotionally? Are there any specific moments of emotion that you can recall? Just made me happy. Oh, it makes me happy. And then it changes what you see when you've stopped looking at the art.

Um, speaking more about the artistic side, what stood out to you most about the experience as a piece of art,

Access. It was nice to be able to see these pieces of art without travelling miles. And queueing to look at them. Is that the proper answer? I can't it doesn't really answer your question, does it? Could you tell me the question again? Sorry what's that to you? Most about this experience as a piece of art I felt I would almost touch it and it would be there.

Uh, to go back to what you said earlier about, um, about access. How did you feel about seeing these art pieces in a place that's different from their original or intended location? I enjoyed it. I think it's great to be able to see art. Without having to Queue for museum.

Um, speaking of museums, how do you think this AR art installation compares to other more traditional ways of experiencing our such as a gathering or traditional public art? I do like a gallery. I like to be able to stand. In front of some of my favourite. Images. In Glasgow. But I've also been Places where you've been shuffled along, hardly able to see the piece of art.

So this was better because I could stay there as long as I wanted. Okay. Uh, is there anything you think could make this experience more impactful or memorable? Don't think so. No, I don't think so. Okay. Um, if this were a freely available uh, would you use it? Oh yeah.

Um, okay. If in using it, what kinds of art would you? Would you see? And what in which locations would you like to see them? A nice empty space like that. courtyard we were in Where I could walk around. I like the statues to be able to walk around.

Paintings. We're good to see but I like the statues. That's what I would go and see. Uh, thank you very much for sharing. Your thoughts. Is there anything else you'd like to add about your experience with the air? In art installation. Know what do ask me again. Anytime I enjoyed it.

Um, before we go, are there any questions that you have from me about this study? No, I can't think anything. I hope it helps with bringing arts to people that can't get out and about. Okay, thank you very much.
