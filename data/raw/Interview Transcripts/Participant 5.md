Let me thank you for participating in this interview. We're interested in understanding your overall experience with the AR public art. This conversation is about your thoughts and feelings. There are no right or wrong answers. Okay firstly, what was your overall impression of the experience? I thought it was quite cool.

Having like the ability to see like are that you normally wouldn't see in Like environment that it wouldn't usually be in I did think it was maybe a bit concerning. When like having large art and like a public space that people could walk through. Like, um, could lead to like some collisions and even like missing wheel information, that could be important that by being like obstructed, by the AR art.

Um following on from that do you think that there might be an issue with distractions in this type of application? Yes, definitely. It, it could definitely distract from Kind of important. real world. Information. And though it isn't moving, it's not really cat. Um, Distracting after what first seen. Um, it it would initially take some air.

Take some detention away from from where they're, what they're doing. Okay. Uh, how would you describe the overall atmosphere created by the art? Uh I think the 2D art was quite like a nice pleasurable experience. Um it kind of like added stuff to the environment like which was like normal like blank walls made kind of like more visually like enjoyable um but 3D was kind of more like intimidating kind of like a large structures and kind of like occluding which kind of like could cause stress and just in like the environment itself.

Um, Following on from that. How did the art change? A perception of the space, especially differentiating between 2D and the 3D art? Yeah. The. The 2D art. Um, sorry. I said that question again. Uh, how did they change the perception of the space? Yeah, so 2D art kind of was like, I'm just kind of like on the walls, kind of like out of the way, or 3D art, kind of made.

You think about the space itself? Like, um, kind of where, where it was positioned, what was going on around it? Where 2D art was kind of just like oh it was on the wall like I know that's a wall. Um, I can like that's kind of meant to be there where the 3D art have been like.

Okay why is this like how is this positioned? How is it like actually yeah harmonising with the environment around it? Did you uh did you feel like you had to account for that and like when manoeuvring did it impede? Uh, your traversal of the space. Yeah, it definitely made you a bit more cautious.

Um, walking around the space is because it's kind of blocking information from you so you can't really see what's behind it. So, if it was on on the pavement or the road, um, you were can like more cautious to get moving that area. Uh how did they AR art make you feel emotionally?

Are there any specific moments of emotion that you can recall? Intimidation from the large pieces that especially being right up and close to them. You kind of kind of feel the, the, the mass of it kind of like, at you. Um, which makes it kind of like an intimidating feeling but also kind of like, Um like an enjoyable, kind of like patient experience with like 2D art.

Actually like it adds a nice addition to a boring space. Which you don't you wouldn't really see. Um somewhat related to that what did out to you most about the experience as a piece of art? Um, Um, Piece of arts that I think, you know what? The express as a whole.

What should that to you front in the experience? Oh, um, probably the the problem with like, occlusion. Um, I think because I feel like a lot of, like, important, real impression can be blocked quite easily with With this kind of like uh, with with either 2D or 3D art, which could be quite concerned for, for how this evolves.

Yeah. Okay. Um, how do you think this AR art installation compares to the other more traditional ways of experiencing our like a gallery or just traditional public art? I think this is quite quite good as a kind of allows Those experiences of. Like an art gallery to experience anywhere, and also like an unfamiliar of places, or allow people, that might not be able to afford to go to art, galleries, in different countries, to see these art to be able to see them in their own environment that they're used to.

Um, how did uh related to that? How did you feel about seeing these art pieces in a place different from their original or intended location? I thought it was very good, very interesting. Um, I don't think it brought away from the art at all. The art is the art is very much itself.

So, um, Allows you to get up and close to, especially and the ark where you could get up. Like see the detail of it. It was very, very interesting. I don't think it brought away from there myself. Uh, is there anything you think could make this experience more impactful or memorable?

Um, Having. Maybe having like, The like, I don't know warnings or something of like People around like allow you to can be more calm in the space when like 3D art can be occluding stuff. Okay, so your main concerns are about safety in this application. Okay. Uh, if there were freely available, would you use this type of application?

Yeah, I don't see why I wouldn't have been nice edition to to a boring environment. Where we spend most your day looking at the same thing. You'd be like, oh next edition of nice art on my wall, kind of idea. Um, and on that topic, uh, if you were using it, what kind of art and in, which sort of locations would you use it?

Probably just like, um, like the the 2D art more than anything, just kind of like if I'm sitting on the same kind of room all day. Studying like have like an extra like a different piece of art on the wall, could be very like an interesting and kind of visually different It's going to be oily.

Cool. Uh, thank you for sharing your thoughts. Is there anything else you'd like to add to about your experience with the AR and our installation? No. Thanks. I've talked about everything. Cool. Um, Before we wrap up or do you have any questions from me about um, this study? No, I'm good.

Cool. Thank you very much, no more.
