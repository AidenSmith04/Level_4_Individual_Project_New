Your research purposes. Thank you for participating in this interview. We're interested in understanding your overall experience with the AR public audit. This conversation is about your thoughts and feelings. There are no right or wrong answers. Firstly, what was your overall impression of the experience? Um, it was very exciting, very engaging.

Especially because I wanted to try the metaquest. Cool. How would you describe the overall atmosphere created by the art? The art created by. The environment created by the 2D models. I enjoyed very much, but the 3D models I found very disorienting Uh, in what way did you find that disorientating Um, from afar, it was okay.

I mean, they were kind of disproportionate to The world around them. Like it was very much like a 3D model put into the real world. No, it was kind of But um, It was the actual textures of the models themselves when I kind of got closer to it, my brain was now like Oh, like I do not like that.

There's something wrong there and I found it very disoriented Uh, on that topic. How did the art change your perception of the space? It drew focus away from the actual real world around me and said, I was my attention was pulled to the 2D art or the 3D art. With in your opinion, is that a good thing or a bad thing?

I'm considering the intended purposes of that it was a good thing. Like you you want to be drawn to that if that's what the the aim of it is. Okay. Uh, how did the art make you feel emotionally? Are there any specific moments of emotion you can recall? I just like the banksy paintings but I loved that paint when I was younger.

So having the red balloon made me smile, cool. Uh, what should I do? Most about this experience as a piece of art.

Can you repeat the question? Sorry. What stood out to you most about this experience? As a piece of art as a piece of art as in the metaquest? Overall kind of no as in the as the as in the app. The experience with the The models in the 3D space.

Um, It's very mixed. I think it's really cool. But it's very it feels very found footage from the back rooms which I enjoy very much. I think that's a very cool kind of Approach to engage with it in, but The texture for the 3D models, disoriented me really kind of Three me off.

I didn't made me feel quite exactly. Okay. How do you think this ARR installation compares to other, maybe more traditional ways of experiencing R such as galleries or traditional public art? I think it's more accessible, which is really good so it means there's more people that can experience that but then That in itself is only if you have access to a very expensive piece of equipment.

However, I don't feel you get to enjoy the full Extent of it as you wouldn't real life. But maybe I'm just very Old school. Uh, how did you feel about seeing these art pieces in a place different from their original or intended locations?

It didn't have any particular feelings for it. Like, Like it was nice seeing it out with this environment. Yeah, it was strange and Um, it made more sense in the quad than it did in the road. The road felt very like, Like during the survey. I was like it's not really that memorable.

Okay. Uh, is there anything you think could make this experience more impactful or memorable? I think if the models were both 2D and 3D war, Like I know that it's obviously just in its beginning stages but like Like things like the paintings clipping through the walls that I'm mutually pulled you out with the illusion or the textures, the 3D models.

Yes and the quad, I didn't feel as sickly interacting with them. But I think that's also because they were they were I couldn't go in the grass so they were at a distance from me. Whereas on the road it was like Like going straight up towards it immediately pulled me out.

Like, I didn't want to be in it anymore. Cool. Uh, if this were publicly available, would you use this kind of experience?

Yes, I would, but it wouldn't be to enjoy. Virtual things in a real environment is very much me to enjoy. I think I'm much more of a VR person than I am an AR, right? Okay. Um, if you were to use this, what kind of art would you like to see and in what kind of locations would you like to see it?

I think experiences like Like seem like the Sistine Chapel stuff, I mean like actually like huge places that unless you were to travel to that part of the world to go and see you wouldn't have access to it naturally, right. So you you favour Uh more of a of a virtual rather than an augmentation of the existing space.

Yeah, I think the the actual augmentation itself kind of It wasn't lining up with my brain properly. Okay. Uh, thank you for sharing your thoughts. Is there anything else you'd like to add about your experience with the AR in art installation? Just when the AR set was going towards mouth, like it would start.

Like shaking and like like my like my eyes were going um and that was like that also added to the Like oh wow. Like I feel quite sick right now. Okay. Um, before we go, are there any last questions you have for me about this study? Enjoying it. Thank you very much.
