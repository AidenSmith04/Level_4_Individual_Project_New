Um, thank you for participating in this interview. We're interested in understanding your overall experience with the AR Public Art. This conversation is about your thoughts and feelings. There are no right or wrong answers. Firstly, what was your overall impression of the experience? It was quite new because I'd never studied AR before.

And it was. Yeah, not what I expected but it was just Quite Cool Uh, how would you describe the overall atmosphere created by the art?

Yeah, I think it depended a lot on the place where there was some places where it felt like the art fitted in more than others. Like, When it was like on the busy road and those people walking past, you couldn't really like it just felt really out of place, so it didn't really be able to, we didn't really create an atmosphere because it was quite disjointed, but then when it was like in the Quadrangle, for example, it was a lot more like, But you be home so they said yeah so that made it better.

Fair enough. Uh, how did the art change your perception of the space? I mean, it didn't really it still look the same. Okay. Was there any was there any difference between as you mentioned the busy? University Avenue. They did it. Change your perception, of space more than it. Did the calmer opener spaces?

I feel like it was it. I added something to where it was a lot more still. Whereas when you were like, um, Walking, when there was a busy space and there was these people walking in front of the art and he was trying to not crash into anyone, you're more focused on that than the Arts are almost took away from the space.

So I think it had a lot depending on atmosphere. Uh, how did the AR art make you feel emotionally? Can you recall any specific uh, moments of emotions? Um, not really. Um, what stood out to you most about the experience as a piece of art, It was a lot bigger than what I was expecting.

A lot of them or like looking at the sizes I was I know. It's cool. Uh, how do you think this AR art installation compares to other ways of experiencing art such as galleries or traditional public art? It's good for this is like less people around in a way.

So it's not like there's a, there'll never be like, a queue to go see it because you can move it to wherever you want to see it. Really? So that's quite good. Uh, following up on that, do you think that it's the sort of thing that could be put anywhere?

Or are there specific locations that they would suit better? I think what I said before, it's better when there's, not a lot of people or moving stuff, for example, in the Um, Arc, when it was Constantly disappearing by the columns or appearing part of the column that kind of took you out of the experience, whereas in the quadrangle because it was just kind of like there all the time.

It looked it was a lot more. Better basically. Fair enough. Um, how did you feel about seeing these art pieces in a place different from their original or intended location? I don't think I've ever seen them in there original or intended like a human, sorry. Do you feel um on the same topic?

Do you feel that? Uh, it changes the artist's intentions in any way, if I put putting them in somewhere else. No, because they're intentions are to like view and just see how it feels and a lot of I doubt anyone, you create those pieces of would imagine, they're used nowadays or this would be insane to them.

So I doubt I think they just wanted people to enjoy it or feel something when they look at it. Okay. Uh, is there anything you think could make this experience more impactful or memorable?

Not really, but it did kind of bug me like with the statues where, unless I was looked at a very specific spot on how my hand in a very specific spot. It's actually just be coming in and out my vision. That was quite distracting me up. Okay. Uh, if this were, uh, freely available, would you use it?

If yes, what kind of arts and in which kind of locations generally I think I'd be less if yes, but I'd be less interested in the statues because I feel like you can only really place you need quite a wide open space. It's not that busy to face them.

I'd be more interested in seeing Like paintings on a wall like, Remembered it was there and then you can see it when you walk past kind of thing, okay? Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Is there anything else you'd like to add about your experience? With this AR art installation?

About the glasses where that I wore my glasses for one and they're not the other and I greatly impacted my ability to see the Art. So that is something else to consider. Okay. Thank you very much before we go. Uh, do you have any questions from me about this study?

Not really, okay, good luck. Thank you very much.
