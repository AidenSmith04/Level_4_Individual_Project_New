Thank You for participating in this interview, we're interested in understanding your overall experience with the AR public art. This conversation is about your thoughts and feelings. There is no right or wrong answers. Firstly, what was your overall impression of the experience? It was Quite cool. I like being able. I like walk around it and see through it and stuff.

How would you describe the overall atmosphere created by the art? Um, I think the bit's chosen fit the places for the most part and kind of adds to the area. Was there any pieces of art that you thought weren't didn't fit in, as well? Um, kind of everything on University.

Avenue felt kind about a place there. I do think that, do you think that's an issue with the the location or with the art for the location? But also like, I don't know. Paintings like being on a fence like that feels a bit odd almost. But okay. Uh, how did how did the art change your perception of the space?

Um, I don't know, mostly just drew my attention to those and not really the space itself. In the At the ARC, it was Kind of did because you could like walk around the space more and actually see the art so it, kind of adds to the place. Like feels more alive.

I guess not a big flat square. Okay, so It relating to that, would you say that? More. Naturally empty places would be more natural places to I think for this type of experience, okay. Um, how did the AR make you feel emotionally, any specific moment of emotion? You can recall?

Um, it was impressive, mostly I think. Okay. Um, Yeah. What stood out most to you about the experience as a piece of art Um, I think my favourite thing was the kind of like gate Wally thing, the big black one. I just being able to look through that and kind of walk around, it was really cool.

Yeah. Uh in in relation to that the the there were two predominant types of art, there was the mainly more classical historical type and the more modern ones were there any like preference for like individual spaces or um, probably just the historical in general. I like more. But I think that's more just a personal thing.

Okay. Um, how do you think this AR art installation compares to other ways of experiencing arts such as galleries or traditional public art? Now, I think I'd prefer real art but in places where you can't do that, it's a nice touch. Um, In in relation to that. How did you feel about seeing these art pieces in a place different from their original or intended location?

I think it was interesting thing to see, Just a place change, kind of. Is there anything you think could make this experience more impactful or memorable? Um, Guess a variety of art between the places but it was probably for experiment design that you didn't change it. As of the, of the different kinds of art.

What, what suggestions would you have for? Are you might place in the locations that we've looked at. Um, I guess like for the paintings in particular stuff that kind of matches the vibe of the place a bit more. Okay, like the heart one, especially if you know, I mean, by that seemed to be random in some places but yeah.

Okay. Um, Uh, if this were publicly available, would you use it? And if so, what kinds of art and which locations would you use it? Probably not. I'm not really it but yeah, our person that's fair enough. Uh, thank you for sharing your thoughts. Is there anything else you'd like to add about your experience with the AR art installation?

Um, It was. Kind of embarrassing. Wearing it headset in public. Yes. Before we go, is there any questions you have for me? Not really. Okay, thank you very much.
