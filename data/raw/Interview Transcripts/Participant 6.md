Uh, thank you for participating in this interview. We're interested in understanding your overall experience with the AR public art. This conversation is about your thoughts and feelings. There are no right or wrong answers. Firstly, what was your overall impression of the experience?

Hey, it was really interesting to Be able to see the art in place. and get a feel for how, it would look without having to Actually put it in place. So, It was very realistic. It's And it was really helpful to be able to visualise it. It works really well. Um, how would you describe the overall experience of the art?

It was interesting, it was an eclectic mix of art. So It was a It might not necessarily be the type of art that you Maybe expect to see in those places. So that was kinda strange. Maybe the, the kind of sizes and things. So It's some way some things that feel a little bit out, place.

So like, so that kind of Change. Maybe how. I felt about it a little bit. It's what I make you expected to see in that area.

But it was useful. To see. That helped. I don't know, give me an idea of Whether or not I Would like to see this or Yeah, it was it was useful to Uh, Speaking about perception. Uh, you said that? Sometimes felt out of place. In terms of being out of place, is that the sort of thing you Uh, you would look for in this experience, or would you look for something that would Harmonise with the typical things you would expect to see in the space?

I think it was interesting. To kind of challenge. Your ideas of what you would want to see and what you wouldn't want to see. So it help you. Think about what? Would be good then but wouldn't be good there.

To make you really think about.

What would work? What wouldn't work? Because you need to think about both. Yeah, you need to be challenged. And it really use it. And it's a great way of doing that because you don't want to go to the expense of sticking, something somewhere. Yes. Yeah. Um, Moving on to more.

Uh, feeling an emotional based stuff. How did the AI make you feel? Emotionally. Are there any specific moments of emotion you can recall? It would be really good fun actually. It, it was unexpected. It was It was actually quite fun. Seeing things that people are like you weren't seeing That was actually pretty enjoyable, I'm pretty easy.

Um, Also, just being able to interact with.

The artworks in a way that you just, there's no way that you can do if they were actually real. You can't get that close. These pieces of art is real life.

So, it was amazing to be able to to get up close. Almost touch, then. Speak it. Speaking about How this differs from other, um, ways of experiencing art, how do you think this AR art installation compares to the other, maybe more traditional ways of experiencing arts which is a gallery or more traditional public art.

I think it's just Interesting more. One more kind of personal with doing it. It's

It's an interesting question.

It's more unique experience. It's a, it's a It's a kinda more.

So, I'm usually experienced. More fun. Um, yeah in that in that, in that In this new way of experiencing art, did you did you feel like Um, We might be missing something because it wasn't displayed in their original or intended location. No, I think you can add it to it because it was Unexpected and different.

Cool. I think he would have been quite. What I liked about the sculptures is you could get up close to the sculptures and look around walk around and look at them in different angles. That was really interesting. You didn't get so much about the paintings. Because they're flat. You could go.

I mean you could go up and work close to them. But that wasn't quite as exciting. But with the sculptures, you could really get Really close because you can't do because with an art galleries. And you could really just, And look at them very different items which you would never be allowed to do in real life.

Yeah and that just added a whole different dimension to it. Which is really interesting. The 2D with locally to be able to go in and be

A bit more interactive, that would be really interesting. On on that topic. Is the is there anything you would? You would change or add to this experience to make it more impactful or memorable? Okay. No, yeah, it would be nice to be able to place things a little bit more.

move things around myself. Size things a little bit more. Just move things around a bit more. And change. The orientation of things, the size of things. Zoom in, and Just, To be able to, to interact a little bit more with If more tailored experience, if this technology were to become readily or freely available, Would you use it?

Is the idea of this that in your everyday spaces for you. Spend time you could augment. So, if I walk into work every day, I could add things into my Exactly exactly. What this studies were. Yeah that could be fabulous. Yeah, people couldn't see it but I'm getting To, to make my My commute much more interesting, make my walks much more checking yes I think it could be really fun but not with a big heavy headset.

Yeah. You said, as you seem to be interested in this, what kind of Arts would you place? I mean, what kind of locations would you generally Place?

I think it would be the 3-dimensional because it's much more interesting. I think it's the kind of thing I'd like to kind of switch up every now in there. And personally, I would probably go more for the Um, It's more modern art type. We're abstract. Personally, but that's Thank you very much for sharing.

Your thoughts. Is there anything else you'd like to add about your experience with the air in art installation. Um, knowledge, those bitty enjoy, it will be very interesting. Well, it's been potential in the future. Thank you very much before we go. Are there any questions you have for me about the study?

Nope. Thank you very much.
