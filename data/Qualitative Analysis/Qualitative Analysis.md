| 1              | It brought more colour to the space and liked the recognisable pieces.                                                                                                                    | Felt people staring at me.

| 5              | Due to the spread of the art the experience felt calming and interesting with a natural addition to the space                                                                             | Nothing I didnâ€™t like or have concerns with                                                                       | No the art and positions were all good                                                                                                                                           | The art was enjoyable to look at adding a nice experience to the space                                                            |
| 6              | Really good way to visualise how the art would look in the space.                                                                                                                         | The way you can see the pictures move through the columns as you walk                                               | Make the pictures larger again.

| 7              | The open nature of the space felt that gave more light to the experience - it felt more open.<br>Art in windows in this location was not as out of place as my experience with the quads. | Clarity (details) in image was not great until you got close to see. Was definitely a sweet spot to get in focus.   | Add: connection between art pieces so that did not seem so disparate and separated.<br>Change: a mixture of 2D and 3D in this space would have felt appropriate and interesting. | This felt like the best place for the 2D art. The size of space and building and windows. Was more enjoyable.                     |
| 8              | The art livened up a boring space                                                                                                                                                         | No concerns                                                                                                         | A few more pieces of art                                                                                                                                                         | Cheered me up                                                                                                                     |

| 10             | I liked getting to see the farm painting up close. I feel like i appreciated the art more in this space than in the quad.

| 1              | Added colour and personality to the space                                                                                    | Mostly a place that shouldn't have 2D art in my opinion                                                                                                                              | Maybe one 2 pieces of art and instead of paintings do poster looking ones on the fences                                                                                                  | Make me happy for the colour in the dark dull street                                                     |
| 2              | I liked being able to see the artwork as I walked by a familiar route                                                        | Not at all really, it's not too obtrusive of reality                                                                                                                                 | Name cards or information panels for each artwork                                                                                                                                        | Not at all no                                                                                            |
| 3              | It was interesting to see a place I know change                                                                              | The lighting on the paintings felt weird, some were hard to see detail                                                                                                               | Not really                                                                                                                                                                               | It was surprising                                                                                        |
| 4              | Wore my glasses this time. Everything was well placed and easier to see                                                      | Kinda felt like having floaters, bad for a headache. If ppl walked in front of the art, or moved quickly in front of u like a cyclist it was very blurry                             | No                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not really                                                                                               |
| 5              | That is added to a visual uninteresting place allowing something interesting to be looked at while say going between classes | That the art didnâ€™t feel physically there due to perspective shifts between closer objects like the fence and further object like the trees                                        | Have the art lower down or place directly to the fence so the perspective of the art doesnâ€™t feel like itâ€™s changing from close to far constantly                                    | Pleasantly as it added something visually interesting to a boring place                                  |
| 6              | Really helpful to visualise the art in the space                                                                             | No concerns                                                                                                                                                                          | Larger paintings, they felt too small in the space.                                                                                                                                      | Enhanced the space                                                                                       |
| 7              | Getting closer to art that was safe to access was great.                                                                     | Navigating to the far away art felt strange because the art was small.<br>Didn't like the environment for this - the art for this location jarred and seemed off (even the banksy).  | Add: something to connect the art pieces (background banner or images)<br>Change: different art, e.g. graffiti or poster art would have been really interesting to see in this location. | Getting close to one of art pieces (landscape) was great. Made me feel calm and warm (thought of summer) |
| 8              | It was interesting seeing some things that I knew werenâ€™t really there                                                     | After a few seconds it was fine                                                                                                                                                      | No                                                                                                                                                                                       | Att in most of its forms makes me happy                                                                  |
| 9              | It was interesting and pleasant change to a route I know by heart and use daily.                                             | Far too small / placed too far from the fences to see details.                                                                                                                       | I would make them much closer to the fence, as if paintings are fixed to it.                                                                                                             | It was engaging and very pleasant to see the art just walking by on the street                           |
| 10             | Mona lisa and the farm were pretty well positioned and nice to look at                                                       | The space was very busy with people and traffic, and the art fit slightly strangely in the space. The technology felt slightly unsafe to use in the space, so maybe not appropriate. | The art was mostly okay to look at in the scene, but i would not personally choose to view art in this space                                                                             | I felt like i had less time to appreciate it with the busy crowds and traffic nearby                     |
| 11             | The road was a nice setting.                                                                                                 | The positioning of the paintings.                                                                                                                                                    | Have different paintings.                                                                                                                                                                | It wasn't as impactful as the quad because of the positioning of the art.                                |
| 12             | Cool paintings                                                                                                               | Disorienting after approaching metal materials                                                                                                                                       | No                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                          |

| 6              | The art added a bit of extra interest to the scene without taking away from the beauty of the quad.  Any bigger though would have detracted from the space.

The art in the windows felt artificial. Being mounted (or able to be mounted) on the walls would have felt more natural and less visually jarring.<br>Technology was easy to use in this space, although seeing some of the far away art was difficult initially until I got closer to the art. Seeing the art floating as I moved closer was unusual (new experience). Perhaps if there was a way to indicate that there was art there but it only shows the details (2D art) until you are closer would be better. Also having the art fixed rotationally would have enhanced the experience. | Add: numbers or explanations of what art is (like in other art galleries).<br>Remove: floating aspect of art as you are far away.<br>Change: some art was too small. Could there be an option to zoom in - this would be great as not an option you get when visiting an art gallery. | I enjoyed the banksy more as felt most appropriately sized.                                                |

| 10             | I thought it was very cool seeing the statues in the quadrant, especially being able to see them from all angles. The statues fit very naturally into the space.                                                                              | One statue was very slightly leant backwards when i placed it, but not by much (a very minor grievance that didnt affect my feelings towards the experiment in any great degree). The rest was fantastic. The technology was appropriate for the space. | It would be cool to be able to go up to the statues, but due to rules in the quad you cant go on the grass :( | The grand scale of the art was exciting, and seeing it occupy the large space was really cool.                                         |
